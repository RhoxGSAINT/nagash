To this end, secure the Mortarchs' support, starting with Arkhan the Black, and empower the Black Pyramid in Nehekhara.\\n\\n[[col:dark_g]]Places of Death[[/col]]\\nThese sites of power are of outmost importance to complete the Great Ritual.\\n\\n[[col:dark_g]]Dominion of Undeath[[/col]]\\nNagash's armies are a mix of mobile hordes and traditional armies, most settlements are of little value to him. However, within province capitals you can construct buildings that will provide you with additional caps for units belonging to these cultures [[img:res_nag_coast]][[/img]][[img:res_nag_counts]][[/img]][[img:res_nag_nagash]][[/img]][[img:res_nag_nehek]][[/img]], so they can be risen to join your legions.\\n\\n[[col:dark_g]]The Mortarchs[[/col]]\\nArkhan may be a willing servant, but you will need to bind some of the Vampire Lords back into your service. Once they are subjugated through the {{tr:technology_header}} tree, they will join your forces as Legendary Lords with their own horde armies and unique features.\\n\\n[[col:dark_g]]Legions of Undeath[[/col]]\\nNagash and his Mortarchs can recruit units into their armies without the need to pay for their recruitment, but he does need to employ {{tr:icon_money}} for upkeep. Most units have a limited initial recruitment capacity which can be increased by constructing additional buildings, either in settlements or hordes.\\n\\n[[col:dark_g]]Warpstone[[/col]]\\n{{tr:tooltip_nag_warpstone}}	true
