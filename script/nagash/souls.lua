-- the scripted mechanics revolving around the raising of the BP and what not

-- TODO "unlock ritual" when the BP is occupied by Nagash (or upgraded to a certain level? some other criterion?)
-- TODO spawn intervention armies (use the welf system) when the ritual begins
-- TODO set the ritual in some cute UI, something floating on the BP region?
