]]

--- Early turn stuff, should be very basic and culminate in obtaining the Blyryaryamind
-- Step 1: Arkhan-triggered mission to defeat an early enemy (scropt spawned)
-- Step 2: Something droll, like win 5 battles, win 5 battles against TK, raze three settlements, something
-- Step 3: Destroy/Conquer the Sentinels of Nagash
-- Ultimate: Fight a QB for Blyramid (either defense or assault), after which Arkhan joins you full time! (QB from the PoV of Arkhan, with Nagash reinforcements?)
