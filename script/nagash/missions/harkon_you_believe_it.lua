--- Help Harkon get out of Lustria, help insanity
-- Step 1: Send an agent to Lustria? Set foot in a port region? Something along the lines of "get word to Harkon"
-- Step 2: Get some Lizardmen plaques
-- Step 3: ??
-- Ultimate: Harkon fights off Lizardmen & Empire troops to pull out of Lustria and join Natasha in Southlands (or wherever they are).
-- Fleeing-type battle, "survive and gtfo" instead of "kill them all"
